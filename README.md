# Drag-and-Load
Chrome extension to allow saving of images via dragging.

Download images via drag and drop. Drag the image to any direction and drop it.
The image will be downloaded to Chrome's default download location.
Works on all images of the following file types: jpg, jpeg, jpe, gif, png.

Changelog:

v1.3:
Added the ability to download background images.

v1.2:
The minimum image size can now be configured in the extension's options. Only images with a size greater than this width and height will be downloaded when dragged.
This helps to prevent the accidental download of thumbnail images.

v1.1:
Support for webp was dropped (because from time to time, I ended up downloading thumbnails on youtube).

v1.0:
Initial release
